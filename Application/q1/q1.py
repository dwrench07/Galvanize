"""Question 1:

Create a text content analyzer. This is a tool used by writers to find statistics 
such as word and sentence count on essays or articles they are writing.

Write a Python program that analyzes input from a file and compiles statistics on it.

The program should output:

1. The total word count
2. The count of unique words
3. The number of sentences

Example output:

Total word count: 468  
Unique words: 223  
Sentences: 38

Brownie points will be awarded for the following extras:
1. The ability to calculate the average sentence length in words
2. The ability to find often used phrases (a phrase of 3 or more words used over 3 times)
3. A list of words used, in order of descending frequency
4. The ability to accept input from STDIN, or from a file specified on the command line.

This question should be written in Python.Â
