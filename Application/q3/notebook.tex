    \subsection{Question 3:}\label{question-3}

As context, here's a 10,000-foot view of the Acme Corp product:

\subsection{}\label{section}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A consumer posts a~request~for a service needed. Every request is in
  some~category~(e.g., Catering, Personal Training, Interior Design) and
  some~location~(e.g., New York, San Francisco).
\item
  We match the request up with appropriate service providers and send
  each of those providers an~invite~to quote on the request.
\item
  Providers view the invite and some choose to send a~quote~to the
  consumer expressing interest.
\end{itemize}

For the following questions, please be as specific and thorough as
possible in your answers, quantify your statements as much as you can,
and explain your computations. Include code you used where appropriate.
You're free to use any software you like; it's OK if we can't run the
analysis ourselves. You're encouraged to be as technical as you like in
your answers, they don't need to be accessible to general readers
(though that's an important part of the actual job).

\subsubsection{Split Test Analysis}\label{split-test-analysis}

\subsection{}\label{section-1}

I've just concluded a test of our~quote form. After receiving an invite,
service providers come to the quote form to view the consumer request
and choose whether or not to pay to send a quote. My goal was to
determine if certain changes to the design of the form would cause more
providers to send a quote after coming to the page.

Over the course of a week, I divided invites from about 3000 requests
among four new variations of the quote form as well as the baseline form
we've been using for the last year. Here are my results:~~~~~~~~

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Baseline: 32 quotes out of 595 viewers
\item
  Variation 1: 30 quotes out of 599 viewers
\item
  Variation 2: 18 quotes out of 622 viewers
\item
  Variation 3: 51 quotes out of 606 viewers
\item
  Variation 4: 38 quotes out of 578 viewers
\end{itemize}

What's your interpretation of these results? What conclusions would you
draw? What questions would you ask me about my goals and methodology? Do
you have any thoughts on the experimental design? Please provide

statistical justification for your conclusions and explain the choices
you made in your analysis.

For the sake of your analysis, you can make whatever assumptions are
necessary to make the experiment valid, so long as you state them. So,
for example, your response might follow the form~``I would ask you A, B
and C about your goals and methodology. Assuming the answers are X, Y
and Z, then here's my analysis of the results\ldots{} If I were to run
it again, I would consider changing\ldots{}''.

    \textbf{Here is the data formatted as a CSV:}

    Bucket,Quotes,Views\\
Baseline,32,595\\
Variation~1,30,599\\
Variation~2,18,622\\
Variation~3,51,606\\
Variation~4,38,578

    \paragraph{Q: What's your interpretation of these
results?}\label{q-whats-your-interpretation-of-these-results}

A: My interpretation of the A/B testing is that there area varying
conversion rates for quotes per variation (5.38\%, 5.00\%, 2.89\%,
8.42\%, 6.62\%) respectively.

\paragraph{Q: What conclusions would you
draw?}\label{q-what-conclusions-would-you-draw}

A: I would conclude nothing until answering the below questions.

\paragraph{Q: What questions would you ask me about my goals and
methodology?}\label{q-what-questions-would-you-ask-me-about-my-goals-and-methodology}

A: I would ask the following: - Are these variations statistically
significant? - Are these all unique viewers? - Were the users selected
randomly who received a variation of the control? - Are the control
population and variant population comprable? - Why Multi-invariants were
not used? - Were the quotes higher or lower on average per variation? -
Was there a difference in Clicks-to-Quotes? Meaning, did some variations
make it easier to fill out a quote? - Is one week adequate time to
adjust to changes?

\paragraph{Q: Do you have any thoughts on the experimental
design?}\label{q-do-you-have-any-thoughts-on-the-experimental-design}

A: - Single-Metric design, could use more variables based on my above
questions on methodology. - Was there any ``Change Aversion'' noticed or
vocalized by the users?

    \textbf{Assumptions}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Variations were presented randomly.
\item
  Quotes averages were the same.
\item
  Variation in form complexity and ease of use were neglegible.
\item
  Viewers were unique.
\item
  The quotes are independant, one quote or many quotes does not affect
  other viewers quoting.
\end{enumerate}

    \textbf{Hypothesis Testing}

    With such a relatively small difference in conversion rates (5.38\%,
5.00\%, 2.89\%, 8.42\%, 6.62\%), however, can we convincingly say that
the variation converts better?

To test the \emph{statistical significance} of a result like this, a
hypothesis testing can be used.

    First we would want to calculate the population mean and then the
confidence intervals (95\% in most cases). Then of each variation of the
new forms, determine whether that variation of the forms p-value is
greater or less than 0.05 giving us reason to accept of reject the `Null
Hypothesis' (if the sample data (variation(s)) are drawn for the same
population).

After determining that we can infer whether or not each variation had a
statistically significant increase, or decrease in quotes compared to
the baseline.
