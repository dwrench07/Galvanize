    "\n",
    "- A consumer posts a request for a service needed. Every request is in some category (e.g., Catering, Personal Training, Interior Design) and some location (e.g., New York, San Francisco).\n",
    "- We match the request up with appropriate service providers and send each of those providers an invite to quote on the request.\n",
    "- Providers view the invite and some choose to send a quote to the consumer expressing interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the following questions, please be as specific and thorough as possible in your answers, quantify your statements as much as you can, and explain your computations. Include code you used where appropriate. You're free to use any software you like; it's OK if we can't run the analysis ourselves. You're encouraged to be as technical as you like in your answers, they don't need to be accessible to general readers (though that's an important part of the actual job).\n",

    "I've just concluded a test of our quote form. After receiving an invite, service providers come to the quote form to view the consumer request and choose whether or not to pay to send a quote. My goal was to determine if certain changes to the design of the form would cause more providers to send a quote after coming to the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of a week, I divided invites from about 3000 requests among four new variations of the quote form as well as the baseline form we've been using for the last year. Here are my results:        \n",

So, for example, your response might follow the form \"I would ask you A, B and C about your goals and methodology. Assuming the answers are X, Y and Z, then here's my analysis of the results... If I were to run it again, I would consider changing...\"."
